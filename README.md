# Blaze Starter

Great template for Flutter projects. 
During the development of this template, I studied the best practices of the most popular Flutter templates and repositories, tried to combine them in one template, adding something special and new.
This starter reduces time spent on creating new project. Just click **Use this template** and here you go.
