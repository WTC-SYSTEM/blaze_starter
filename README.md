# Sizzle Starter

Great template for Flutter projects. 
During the development of this template, I studied the best practices of the most popular Flutter templates and repositories, tried to combine them in one template, adding something special and new.
This starter reduces time spent on creating new project. Just click **Use this template** and here you go. 
Below there are some instructions on how to use this template and very useful topics especially for newbies

# Starting up

Yep. Let's imagine you are starting a new project OR starting learning flutter.
If second, I would recommend you to read [this](https://flutter.dev/docs) first.
This project is supposed to be as easy as it could be, at same time flexible 
and clean. But, you need kinda good knowledge in Dart and Flutter to understand it.

## Flutter\Dart resources
1. [Flutter docs](https://flutter.dev/docs) - official docs, one of the best ways of learning
2. [Dart docs](https://dart.dev/guides) - official dart docs
3. [DartPad](https://dartpad.dev/) - it's a great tool to play with Dart, has some examples and tutorials
4. [Flutter official codelabs](https://flutter.dev/docs/codelabs) - Flutter Google Codelabs(great starting point)
5. [Dart official codelabs](https://dart.dev/codelabs) - Dart Google Codelabs(very little, but still)
6. [Great Roadmap](https://plugfox.dev/flutter-developer-roadmap/)
7. [Communities](https://plugfox.dev/communities/)
8. [Influencers](https://plugfox.dev/influencers/)

## How to run
1. Click `Use this template` button
2. Clone this repository via `git clone`(you can choose HTTPs, but I would recommend SSH as it is really more comfortable and safe)
3. Decide which platforms your app will be running on
4. Decided, run `flutter create . --org com.yourdomain --platforms ios,android,... or nothing if you are writing an app for each platform` in your terminal.
5. Run `flutter pub get` to install all dependencies
6. Run `flutter run` to run your app
7. Here you go, start coding!
